## Development Setup

1. Clone your fork:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/telegram-bot-framework.git
   cd telegram-bot-framework
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   make venv
   source .venv/bin/activate
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   make dev-install
   ```

   ```

## Coding Standards

### Python Style Guide

- Follow PEP 8
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Add docstrings to all functions and classes
- Keep functions small and focused
- Use type hints where appropriate

### Testing

- Write unit tests for all new functionality
- Maintain or improve code coverage
- Use descriptive test names that explain what is being tested
- Follow the AAA pattern (Arrange, Act, Assert)

### Commit Messages

- Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
- Use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...")
- Limit the first line to 72 characters or less
- Reference issues and pull requests liberally after the first line

Example:

```
Add retry logic for network failures

- Implement exponential backoff
- Add configurable max retry attempts
- Handle specific error types differently

Fixes #123
```
